# System and Compute MCP Server Ecosystem
building an MCP server from docs, integrating it with claude code, and deploying it. building with Node.js, MCP SDK, and Anthropic SDK and API.


## What the project does

The repository contains an MCP server implementation that can be used by agent-based applications and local LLM clients. It provides a small set of tools that allow agents to:

- perform various calculations requiring basic math operations and square roots
- read and write files within a controlled workspace
- inspect system information such as platform, memory, and runtime details
- make HTTP GET requests to public APIs or other web endpoints
- manage simple task data through a SQLite-backed store

## Project structure

- lab/server.js: the main stdio-based MCP server entry point
- httpmcpserver/http_server.js: an HTTP/SSE server for remote or browser-based clients
- lab/tools/: tool modules for compute, filesystem, web, system, and database actions
- middleware/: authentication and rate-limit support for the HTTP server
- data/ and lab/data/: database setup, logging, and bootstrap helpers

## Why it exists

This lab is intended as a learning and prototyping environment for:

- understanding how MCP servers expose tools to agents
- integrating tools with Claude-style or other LLM clients
- testing safe tool patterns, logging, and basic server security
- exploring how agent workflows can interact with local files, systems, and data

## Technologies

- Node.js and JavaScript/ES modules
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) SDK
- Express for the HTTP server
- SQLite for local task storage
- Anthropic and related SDKs for agent integration
- GCP Cloud Run for Serverless Deployment
